FILE PIPELINE:

Directions for running each file are written in respective file descriptions. Files should run completely if Tensorflow is installed correctly. The data need only be downloaded from code.org/research and put in the same directory as the files. Preprocessed data should appear in subdirectories listed in data_preprocess, which is contained in global variables in the remainder of the files.
